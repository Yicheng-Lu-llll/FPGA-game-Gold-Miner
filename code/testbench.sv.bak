// IMPORTANT:
// 1. This testbench for week 2 requires about 280 us(microsecond) to run,
// so please set the simulation period to be AT LEAST 280 us.
//
// 2. The function of each test is sensitive to the delay time of each operation.
// During debugging, it is okay to add operations, but please DO NOT change the 
// delay time of those existing operations. Otherwise, TAs may have trouble finding
// the desired results, as well as giving you credits on that.
//
// 3. It is encouraged to run tests following their orders, rather than running all
// at once,  for the sake of debugging. For example, you can start from running the
// first test. Then, uncomment the second test to run the first and the second test
// together, etc.
// Or, you may choose to run one of them by commenting the others, since the results
// of each test are independent of the other tests. Though, as the lab manual suggests,
// it is only your slc3 runs earlier tests correctly that it can run the later tests
// correctly.
//
// In case you do not know how to set the simulation period, here are the steps
// step 1: in [Assignments] tab choose [Settings...]
// step 2: under [EDA Tool Settings] tab choose [Simulation]
// step 3: find the [Test Benches...] button and click it
// step 4: in the pop up window, choose "testbench_week2.sv" and click [Edit...]
//         if you cannot find this testbench, please add this first
// step 5: in the pop up window, choose the [End Simulation at:] circle box and 
//         enter the desired simulation time
//
//
